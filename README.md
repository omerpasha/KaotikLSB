# Kaotik LSB Steganography - Test Environment

This repository was created for independent testing of the Chaotic LSB algorithm developed as part of my master's thesis. The encoding and decoding processes were executed separately, and performance measurements were recorded.

Results obtained from the thesis can be found in: test_results.txt
